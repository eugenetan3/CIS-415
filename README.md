# CIS-415
Projects done in CIS-415 - Operating Systems

Projects are centralized around the primary concepts of child processes, synchronization and multithreading, and using system calls for FILE I/O.


**Project 1**
Pseudo-shell implementation to be able to handle simple shell commands such as ls, mv, cp, cat, etc. Uses tokenization of file input or standard input to determine executable commands. All commands created are implemented using solely Linux OS system calls.

**Project 2**
Multi-part project that mimics a multi-control program that manages multiple child processes for every given executable command provided. Allows multiple files to execute and be scheduled using a round-robin scheduling method. 

**Project 3**
Implementation of synchronization and multi-threading. Rounded buffer implementation to store HTML items stored under queues, used so that users can create topic buffers and input specific html URL and URL captions which will then be generated into a HTML template.
